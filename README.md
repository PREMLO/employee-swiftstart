## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways you can edit and manage your application:

Use your preferred IDE

If you prefer working locally (which I usually do), you can clone the repository and push your changes directly. Here's the process I follow:

Step 1: Clone the repository using the project’s Git URL.

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm i
Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and instant preview.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Edit files directly on GitHub

Another way I work is by making quick edits directly in GitHub:

Navigate to the file you want to update.

Click the "Edit" button (the pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.

Make your changes and commit them directly.

Use GitHub Codespaces

For an instant development environment, I sometimes use GitHub Codespaces:

Go to the main page of the repository.

Click the green "Code" button.

Select the "Codespaces" tab.

Click "New codespace" to launch the environment.

Make your changes, then commit and push them.

How do I deploy this project?
Deploying is simple. You can build the project and host it on platforms like Netlify or Vercel for fast and easy deployment.

Can I use a custom domain?
Yes! While there’s no built-in domain support in the default setup, you can easily deploy your project on Netlify or Vercel, both of which support custom domains. Check out their documentation for details.
